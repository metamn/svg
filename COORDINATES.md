# The SVG Coordinate System

http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-coordinate-systems/

### Basics

* **Canvas** &mdash; the area where the SVG is drawn; it's conceptually infinite in both directions (scalable)
* **Viewport** &mdash; the area on the screen where the SVG is rendered. It has a finite size;
* **Clipping** &mdash; if the viewport < canvas the SVG is clipped and the rest is not visible
